### Safeguarded in a secure fortress

[His Holiness (aba)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirza_Masroor_Ahmad) said that he wished to make an appeal:

> _the [Third Caliph (rh)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirza_Nasir_Ahmad) saw a vision in which an elder said to him that every adult in the Community should recite Durood Sharif [prayer for invoking salutations upon the [Holy Prophet (sa)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad)] SubhanAllahi wa bi Hamdihi SubhanAllahil Azeem Allahumma Salle ala Muhammadin wa aali Muhammad (Holy is Allah and worthy of all praise, Holy is Allah the Great, O Allah bestow Thy blessings upon Muhammad and the people of Muhammad) 200 times. Those who are 15-25 years of age recite it at least 100 times, and if children recite it at least 33 times and parents help their infant children recite it at least three to four times. Then recite Astaghfiruallha Rabbi Min Kulli Zanbinwwa Atubu Ilaih (I seek forgiveness from Allah, my Lord, for all my sins and turn to Him) 100 times._

[His Holiness (aba)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirza_Masroor_Ahmad) said that:

> _he would also include the prayer Rabbi Kullu Shay’in Khadimuka Rabbi Fahfazni Wansurni Warhamni (My Lord everything is subservient to You; My Lord protect me, help me and have mercy on me) to be recited not just in these days but generally as well._

> _According to the vision of the [Third Caliph (rh)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirza_Nasir_Ahmad), the elder said that if these were recited then you will **become safeguarded in a secure fortress, impenetrable by Satan, made with iron walls reaching the heavens**._

[His Holiness (aba)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirza_Masroor_Ahmad) said that:

> _these days when Satan is trying to attack our Community and the world at large, the only way for us to remain safeguarded is through prayers. Hence, we should recite these prayers, not just during the days of Jalsa but throughout the year._
