# CHANGELOG

## 20 Dec 2024

- Refined some content. Small grammatical improvements.
- `PrayerCard` component now shows english translation by default alongside the arabic text. There is alternating switch to Urdu. This may change to allow further translations.
  - The arabic text uses more similar looking text normally found in Quran.
  - Proper Urdu font with `rtl` support.
  - The counting buttons now take only **35%** of space and the remaining **65%** of space for arabic text and translation.
- `MultilingualText` NEW component ~ It allows easy and consistent centrally controlled rendering of arabic/urdu texts as well as english text with easy scalable font sizes.
